Comparing Median Salary Among First-term Presidential Staff
-----------------------------------------------------------

Recently the Trump Administration released the first report of staff salaries. I thought it would be interesting to do an analysis that compares it to past EOP offices.

For this analysis, we are going to look at the first year of Presidents Trump, Obama and Bush.

| president |  salary|
|:----------|-------:|
| bush      |   49789|
| obama     |   65000|
| trump     |   89000|

Here we see that Trump's median salary of 89000 is greater than both former president Bush and Obama.

That could be expected as wages should increase with cost of living over time.

The next question I have is: How many Trump staffers are paid the maximum compared to previous administrations? Let's take a look:

| president |  salary|  count|
|:----------|-------:|------:|
| trump     |  179700|     22|
| obama     |  172200|     22|
| bush      |  140000|     17|

In this piece of analysis, I have excluded detailees, as their salaries are paid by other departments. Here I've found that Trump ties Obama for having the largest count of highest paid employees on staff during the first year of their first term. Let's take another look visually to confirm what we're seeing:

Staff Sizes
-----------

Let's take a look at staff sizes and salaries over time:

|  year| president | party      | term  |  medianSalary|  meanSalary|  staffSize|
|-----:|:----------|:-----------|:------|-------------:|-----------:|----------:|
|  2001| bush      | republican | first |         49789|    58042.17|        397|
|  2009| obama     | democrat   | first |         65000|    80384.44|        487|
|  2017| trump     | republican | first |         89000|    94872.00|        377|

Here it appears that President Trump is spending more per staff over all, but with a smaller staff size. This could be problematic for the president in the long run.

So who are these top paid staff members of Trump's administration?

Other than Mark House who is a detailee, all are employees. Probably one of the more well known employees is Steve Bannnon, who is listed as Assistant to the President and Chief Strategist and Senior Counselor.

As it's noted in Wikipedia, each president gets to choose their own cabinet, which means they can also give out their own titles as well. That makes an analysis more difficult, so let's look and see if other presidents retain a senior counsel on staff.
